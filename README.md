# Overlook
A silly project related to forex trading. It allows someone to tinker algos outside the limitations of MT4.

Don't do forex.

#### How to run
To compile Overlook, you need to download and install Ultimate++ and learn to how to compile programs with it. Then, you clone this repository, add it to a new assembly or copy files to MyApps directory.
To run Overlook, you need to run MQL4 script Mt4Connection, which is in the src/plugin/MQL4 folder. The MT4Connection.mq4 goes to the Scripts folder of MT4 and MT4ConnectionDll.dll goes to Libraries folder.
Run "Load Server History" in MT4 to have all data. Restart MT4 before starting Overlook to save history data to disk.
