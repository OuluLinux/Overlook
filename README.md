# Overlook
A project for seeking profitable forex trading automation outside the limitations of MT4.

I programmed a lot MQL before I fed up to those limitations. Now, I try to support useful parts and improve the automation, which would profit me as well as you. There is no point to clone an open source ecosystem of losing algorithms.


#### How to run
To compile Overlook, you need to download and install Ultimate++ and learn to how to compile programs with it. Then, you clone this repository, add it to a new assembly or copy files to MyApps directory.
To run Overlook, you need to run MQL4 script Mt4Connection, which is in the src/plugin/MQL4 folder. The MT4Connection.mq4 goes to the Scripts folder of MT4 and MT4ConnectionDll.dll goes to Libraries folder.
Run "Load Server History" in MT4 to have all data. Restart MT4 before starting Overlook to save history data to disk.
